# TrafficSignDetection


## Overview

In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.  

There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.  

In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

## Models Trained

Models trained for this particular project were CNN and AlexNet on Traffic Sign Dataset which has 50k images and 43 different classes. Diagram below shows the architecture of AlexNet used for the training purpose. Its a pre trained model which is used here for detecting traffic signs accurately

## Results

With Alexnet we achieved an overall accuracy of 89% and with CNN an overall accuracy of 87%
